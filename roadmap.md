# Financial Dashboard Web App Roadmap

## Project Overview
The **Financial Dashboard Web App** will provide users with a customizable dashboard to manage financial data, track markets, view relevant news, and receive AI-driven trade suggestions. The app will have a modular design with features such as path predictions, web scraping for financial news, currency conversion, and AI-based trade recommendations.

## Milestones and Deliverables

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Architecture
1. **Project Initialization**  
   - Set up the project repository on GitHub (or preferred platform).
   - Set up basic file structure for React (frontend) and Node.js (backend).
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automatic testing and deployment.

2. **Backend Architecture**
   - Set up Node.js/Express for backend.
   - Integrate API management for handling financial data.
   - Define models and schema for user data, financial data, and settings (MongoDB/PostgreSQL).

3. **Frontend Architecture**
   - Set up **React.js** for the frontend with initial structure.
   - Create a basic UI wireframe for the modular dashboard.

4. **Authentication & User Profiles**
   - Implement user authentication (e.g., using JWT or OAuth).
   - Enable user profiles to store preferences, portfolio data, and saved modules.

### Phase 2: Financial Data Integration
1. **Integrate Financial APIs**  
   - Set up API calls for real-time stock/crypto/commodity prices (using APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, etc.).
   - Fetch and display historical data for selected markets.

2. **Modular Path Predictions**
   - Implement basic machine learning models for path predictions using API data.
   - Display predictions and trends visually (charts, graphs).

3. **Currency Converter**
   - Integrate a real-time currency conversion API (e.g., OpenExchangeRates).
   - Create a custom currency conversion calculator for user input.

4. **Web Scraping for News**
   - Implement web scraping using **BeautifulSoup** or **Scrapy** for relevant financial articles.
   - Integrate with **Google News API** as a backup for structured news data.
   - Display relevant news articles based on user-selected assets (stocks, markets, etc.).

### Phase 3: AI Trade Suggestions & Notifications
1. **AI-Based Trade Suggestions**
   - Implement machine learning models for trade suggestions based on historical data, news sentiment, and market trends.
   - Set up Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis of scraped news and social media (optional).

2. **Notification System**
   - Build an alert system for price movements, trade suggestions, or breaking news.
   - Enable users to opt-in for notifications (email, SMS, or in-app).

3. **Advanced Portfolio Tracking**
   - Add features for users to track portfolios, profit/loss, and historical performance.
   - Provide risk analysis and asset diversification recommendations.

### Phase 4: UI/UX Enhancements & Deployment
1. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Create a responsive and interactive dashboard using React.js components.
   - Ensure that all modules are customizable and easy to configure (drag-and-drop features).
   - Conduct usability testing for feedback.

2. **Frontend Finishing Touches**
   - Finalize modular designs for all core components (charts, news, currency converter).
   - Add advanced customization options (themes, layout changes).

3. **Testing & Debugging**
   - Perform end-to-end testing for all modules.
   - Ensure the security of API calls and user data.

4. **Deploy to Production**
   - Deploy the backend to a cloud service (AWS, Azure, etc.).
   - Deploy the frontend to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.
   - Set up load balancing and scaling options for the production environment.

### Phase 5: Post-Launch Features
1. **AI Model Optimization**
   - Continuously improve the trade suggestion algorithms based on user feedback and performance data.
   
2. **New API Integrations**
   - Add support for additional financial data sources (e.g., crypto exchanges, bond markets).

3. **Community & Social Integration**
   - Implement user forums or community trading insights.
   - Enable social features like sharing trade suggestions or collaborating on portfolio tracking.
